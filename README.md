Tembo is a free and open-source WordPress plugin that lets you create your own web-enabled relational database applications. With a simple drag-and-drop interface you can create forms, queries and reports on multiple related tables.

Applications created with Tembo are themselves deployed as WordPress plugins. This makes the applications very easy to share, install and update.

Tembo leverages the mySQL database that lives quietly behind every WordPress site. This makes it easy to integrate your project with the rest of your WordPress site.

Current status of Tembo: Version 1.1 is still in development; no release version yet!
